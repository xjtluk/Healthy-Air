### Screenshots

**1.Boot Animation**  
<img src="https://github.com/xjtluk/Healthy-Air/blob/main/Resources/screen1.png" alt="Boot Animation" width="15%">  
The app starts with a visually appealing boot animation.


**2.Main Screen Overview**  
<img src="https://github.com/xjtluk/Healthy-Air/blob/main/Resources/screen2.png" alt="Main Screen" width="15%">  
The top-left displays the slogan, while the right three buttons are used for refreshing data, relocating to the current city, and navigating to the Settings page. The middle section shows the city name, time of data acquisition, and overall air quality assessment. The bottom section contains pollutant cards.


**3. Pollutant Card Details**  
<img src="https://github.com/xjtluk/Healthy-Air/blob/main/Resources/screen3.png" alt="Pollutant Card" width="15%"> <img src="https://github.com/xjtluk/Healthy-Air/blob/main/Resources/screen4.png" alt="Pollutant Card Expanded" width="15%">  
Each pollutant card displays data for PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, and CO. Colors highlight the status: blue (very good), green (good), yellow (medium), orange (slightly polluted), red (unhealthy), and purple (dangerous). Clicking on a pollutant card provides prompts based on current data and allows navigation to the contaminant details page.


**4. Contaminant Details Page**  
<img src="https://github.com/xjtluk/Healthy-Air/blob/main/Resources/screen5.png" alt="Contaminant Details 1" width="15%"> <img src="https://github.com/xjtluk/Healthy-Air/blob/main/Resources/screen6.png" alt="Contaminant Details 2" width="15%"> <img src="https://github.com/xjtluk/Healthy-Air/blob/main/Resources/screen7.png" alt="Contaminant Details 3" width="15%">  
Provides detailed information about each contaminant, including definition, sources, hazards, and protection measures. Explains the harm degree corresponding to different data levels for each pollutant.


**5. Settings Page**  
<img src="https://github.com/xjtluk/Healthy-Air/blob/main/Resources/screen10.png" alt="Settings 1" width="15%"> <img src="https://github.com/xjtluk/Healthy-Air/blob/main/Resources/screen11.png" alt="Settings 2" width="15%"> <img src="https://github.com/xjtluk/Healthy-Air/blob/main/Resources/screen8.png" alt="Settings 3" width="15%">  
Users can manage personal settings after logging into their account: enable/disable prompts, adjust data units, and set data refresh frequency. The search box allows users to check air quality in other cities. Saved preferences, including favorite cities, are displayed upon login.


**6. Additional Information**  
<img src="https://github.com/xjtluk/Healthy-Air/blob/main/Resources/screen9.png" alt="Additional Info" width="15%">  
The app provides product descriptions, user privacy information, and other details.

## Data Collection & Management

### Data Collection

- **Air Quality Data**  
  Fetched from the AQICN API: AQI values, pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, O₃, NO₂, CO, etc.), plus the dominant pollutant.  
- **Location Data**  
  Device GPS determines current coordinates; reverse geocoding converts them into city names.  
- **User Preferences**  
  Notification settings, favorite cities, and update frequency are collected and stored per user.

### Data Handling

- **LocationService**  
  Manages permissions, obtains coordinates, and reverse‑geocodes to city names.  
- **ApiService**  
  Interfaces with AQICN API to fetch data by city name or geo‑coordinates.  
- **Error Handling**  
  Catches API failures or permission issues, showing user‑friendly messages.

### Data Management

- **State Management**  
  `AirQualityProvider` (via Provider) tracks data, user prefs, loading, and errors.  
- **Persistent Storage**  
  User settings and favorites are saved in Firebase Firestore, ensuring cross‑session persistence.

---

## Interactivity

### User Interaction

- **Shake to Refresh**  
  Shake the device to reload air quality data.  
- **Manual Refresh**  
  Tap the refresh icon in the app bar.  
- **My Location**  
  A button fetches AQI for the current GPS location.  
- **Favorites**  
  Add, view, and remove favorite cities for quick access.

### Dynamic UI

- **Live Updates**  
  The UI automatically reflects the latest data.  
- **Pollutant Details**  
  Tap any pollutant to see health effects and protective measures.  
- **Settings**  
  Customize notifications, units, and frequencies on the fly.

### Feedback Mechanisms

- **Snackbars**  
  Notify users of actions (e.g., “Data refreshed,” “City added”).  
- **Error Messages**  
  Display failures (e.g., “Failed to fetch data”) with retry options.

---

## Technical Integration

### AQICN API

- Uses HTTP requests to pull live AQI data.  
- Data is mapped into the `AirQualityData` model.

### Firebase

- **Authentication**  
  Email/password sign‑in, registration, and password reset via Firebase Auth.  
- **Firestore**  
  Stores user settings (`user_settings/{uid}`) and favorites in structured documents.

### Device Features

- **Location**  
  Geolocator & Geocoding for GPS and city name resolution.  
- **Sensors**  
  sensors_plus detects shake events to trigger refresh.

### State & Error Resilience

- Provider ensures UI stays in sync with backend.  
- Catches and handles network, API, and permission errors gracefully.
